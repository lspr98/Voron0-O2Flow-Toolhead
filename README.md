## Highlights
- 2x 4010 blower fans for increased part cooling performance
- compatible with original Voron 0.2 hotend mounts
- easy maintenance due to screw-together-design

## Important notes
Due to the larger fans, you lose roughly 10mm of buildarea in Y direction, resulting in (XYZ) 120mm x 110mm x 120mm
